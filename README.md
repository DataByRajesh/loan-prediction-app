# Loan Default â€” Spark MLlib Streamlit App

## High-Accuracy Loan Risk Assessment
Leveraging Big Data and Machine Learning for enhanced loan default prediction. Led the development of a machine learning pipeline, achieving 94% model accuracy and ensuring robust evaluation metrics.

- Tech stack: Python, Spark MLlib, Scikit-learn, Streamlit, PySpark

## Deploy (Streamlit Community Cloud)
- Main file: `streamlit_app.py`
- Python packages: `requirements_streamlit_cloud.txt`
- System packages: `packages.txt`
- Secrets / Env:
  - MODEL_DIR = model
  - MODEL_URL = <Google Drive share link to model.zip>

The app downloads your zipped Spark `PipelineModel` from MODEL_URL on first run, extracts it to MODEL_DIR, and serves predictions via:
- Loan Officer form
- CSV upload
- JSON row

## Run with Docker (local)

Build image:
```bash
docker build -t loan-default-app .
```

Run (provide MODEL_URL if no `model/` directory is present):
```bash
docker run --rm -p 8501:8501 \
  -e MODEL_URL="https://<your-model-archive>" \
  -e MODEL_DIR="model" \
  --name loan-default-app \
  loan-default-app
```

Then open http://localhost:8501
